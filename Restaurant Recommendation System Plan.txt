Restaurant Recommendation System Plan
Idea: 
- manage everything via airflow
- use GPU and hadoop/spark distributed system
- streaming data pulling 5000 records/day
- Create a recommendation system using Yelp API
- Have a simple python website
- Based on the user location => give out restaurant
- Based on user input, search by zip code -> nlp -> give out restaurant
- Client side + host side
- have api for data retrival
- store restaurant info in json in mongo
- store user info in RDMS
- use machine learning to predict
- use charts+ graphs via Tableau to show customer tendency 
- identify top competitors to the business ->nlp+sentimental analysis 
Pipelines: 
Yelp API -> json -> Mongo -> retreive -> Python code for cleaning -> Cloud ->ML -> evaluate + retrain -> Web
